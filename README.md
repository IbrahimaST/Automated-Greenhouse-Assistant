<i><h6 style="color:white;">C++ Automation Project</h6></i>
<p align="center">The goal of this project is to simulate code that would function within a designed climate-control system for a greenhouse. These greenhouses create optimum growing conditions for plants based on automatic conditioning in results to certain stimuli such as motion, temperature, light, water, etc.</p>

<h4>How It's Made:</h4>
<p>Tech Used: C++, Arduino Uno Board</p>
