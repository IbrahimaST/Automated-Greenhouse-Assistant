<h6>C++ Automation Project</h6>
<p align="center">The goal of this project is to simulate code that would function within a designed climate-control system for a greenhouse. These greenhouses create optimum growing conditions for plants based on automatic conditioning in results to certain stimuli such as motion, temperature, light, water, etc.</p>

## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo

<p>This code cannot be used for college assignments. I value keeping this code on github as part of my portfolio, but as you all know, <b>plagiarism is bad</b>. I spent a non-negligible amount of effort developing and designing this project and I am proud of it! All I ask is to not claim this effort as your own.</p>
