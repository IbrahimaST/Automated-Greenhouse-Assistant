<h6>C++ Automation Project</h6>
<p align="center">The goal of this project is to simulate code that would function within a designed climate-control system for a greenhouse. These greenhouses create optimum growing conditions for plants based on automatic conditioning in results to certain stimuli such as motion, temperature, light, water, etc.</p>
